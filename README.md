# LinkedIn_Job_Application_Automation
 **🚀 LinkedIn Job Application Automation**  This repository contains a Python script that automates the process of applying for jobs on LinkedIn. By utilizing the Selenium library, the script interacts with a web browser, simplifying the job application process and saving valuable time for users seeking multiple opportunities with "easy apply" functionality. 🌟  **Getting Started**  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system and have the Chrome web browser installed as well, as the script uses the Chrome WebDriver. 🐍🌐  1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:     ```    git clone https://github.com/your_username/linkedin-job-automation.git    ```  2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using `pip`:     ```    pip install selenium    ```  3. **Configure the Script:** Open the `apply_job.py` file in your preferred text editor. Replace the placeholder values for sensitive information, such as your LinkedIn account email and password, with your actual credentials. Additionally, provide the direct link to the job section with the search filter set to "easy apply" mode in the `LINK` variable. 🔧💼  4. **Optional: Human Check Delay** (Line 26): If the LinkedIn sign-in process requires a security human check, you can uncomment line 26 in the script to introduce a 30-second delay. During this time, you can manually complete the security check before the script resumes. ⏳✅  5. **Run the Script:** Execute the script using the following command:     ```    python apply_job.py    ```     The script will automatically log in, apply for the specified job, and, if necessary, prompt you to respond to any additional questions related to the job application. 🚀💼  **Error Handling**  In the event of any unexpected errors during the application process, the script will display an error message and provide instructions to contact a designated email address (`your_email@example.com`) for assistance. Ensure to capture and share the error screenshot for swift resolution. 🚨🆘  **Important Note**  This automation script is intended solely for personal use and educational purposes.
