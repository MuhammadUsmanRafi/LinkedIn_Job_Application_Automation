# Automate Your Job Applications on LinkedIn! 🚀 🌟

Are you tired of spending countless hours applying for jobs on LinkedIn? We have the perfect solution for you! Introducing our Python script that automates the entire job application process, allowing you to apply for multiple positions with just a few clicks! Save time and effort while maximizing your job search potential. 💼 🔥

## How It Works

Our powerful script utilizes the Selenium library to interact with your web browser, taking care of the login process and handling the entire job application process on your behalf. Say goodbye to tedious form filling and say hello to a streamlined and efficient application experience! 🤝 💻

## Getting Started

To get started with the automation, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Python and Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the Chrome web browser and Chrome WebDriver.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone our GitHub repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/linkedin-job-automation.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip.

   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```

4. **Configuration:** Open the `apply_job.py` file in your preferred text editor. Provide your LinkedIn email, password, and the direct link to the job search section with the "easy apply" filter.

5. **Optional: Human Check Delay:** If required, uncomment line 26 in the script to introduce a 30-second delay to handle security prompts manually.

6. **Run the Script:** Execute the script using the following command:

   ```
   python apply_job.py
   ```

   Sit back and let the script apply for jobs on your behalf! 🚀 💼
